**Persistence Sweep**
- ~/Library/LaunchAgents
- /Library/LaunchAgents  
- /Library/LaunchDaemons
- Login Items
- Cron jobs
- Shell profiles (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)

- Highlights unknown binaries outside /Applications

**Executable Integrity**
- Code signing verification
- Notarization status
- Recent executables in user areas
- Suspicious browser extensions

**Behavior Monitoring**
- Clipboard address swapping detection
- Unusual network connections
- Non-system process monitoring

## üí¨ Natural Conversation

Nova speaks naturally, without technical jargon:

```bash
# Instead of complex commands, just talk:
nova exec --json "my computer feels slow, can you help?"
nova exec --json "I think something suspicious is running"
nova exec --json "help me clean up my downloads folder"
nova exec --json "check if my passwords are safe"
```

## üîß JSON API Integration

Perfect for integrating into Mac apps:

```json
// Task started
{"id":"0","msg":{"type":"task_started"}}

// Nova's response
{"id":"0","msg":{"type":"agent_message","message":"I'm scanning your Mac for threats..."}}

// Security scan results
{"id":"0","msg":{"type":"exec_command_end","stdout":"Found 3 suspicious files..."}}

// Task complete
{"id":"0","msg":{"type":"task_complete"}}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nova-shell.git
cd nova-shell
./build-nova-binary.sh

# Cross-compile for different platforms
./build-nova-binary.sh v1.0.0 x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
./build-nova-binary.sh v1.0.0 aarch64-apple-darwin
```

## üéØ Use Cases

**For Regular Users**
- "scan my Mac for viruses"
- "clean up my computer"
- "check if my passwords are safe"
- "help me organize my files"

**For Developers**
- "debug this Python script"
- "help me build this React app"
